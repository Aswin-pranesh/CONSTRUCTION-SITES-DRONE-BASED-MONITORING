# CONSTRUCTION-SITES-DRONE-BASED-MONITORING
Project Description:
This project employs drones to conduct frequent and efficient surveillance of construction sites. The primary objective is to streamline site management by using drones to monitor different sections of a building. Drones initially scan specified areas, collect data, and upload it to the cloud, where it can be accessed by project stakeholders and supervisors. This setup facilitates remote tracking of construction progress and site activities, saving both time and resources. By substituting human labor with drone surveillance in hazardous zones, the project also realizes significant cost savings.

Components Used:
Drones: Robust, high-endurance drones capable of withstanding environmental challenges to ensure reliable monitoring.
AWS Cloud: A centralized cloud storage solution for easy access to data and effective data management.
LiDAR Sensor: LiDAR sensors provide 360-degree scanning capabilities, offering thorough coverage of the construction site.
Grafana: A real-time data visualization tool that supports better decision-making and oversight.

Objectives:
In large-scale construction projects, such as those involving buildings up to 100 floors, monitoring every area can be challenging and dangerous for human inspectors, especially in hard-to-reach locations. Drones help mitigate these challenges, making site monitoring more efficient, safer, and cost-effective.
